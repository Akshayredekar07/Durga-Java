char literal:

we can specify char literal as single character in signle quote

char ch = 'a';//valid
char ch = a'//invalid Compile time error 
char ch = "a"//invalid CE: incompatible type required: char , found:int

char ch= 'ab';// CE: unclosed char literal 


we can specify char literal as intgral literal which represents unicode value of the character and that integral literal either in decmal octal or hexadecimal form

but allowed range is 0 to 65535

char ch = 97;
sout(ch)

char ch = 0xFace;
sout(ch)

char ch = 65535;

char ch = 65536; //CE: possible loss of precision found:int required:char




we can represent char literal as in unicode representation which is nothing but 
'\uxxxx' flour digit hexadecimal representation


char ch = '\u00061'
sout(ch)

Escape character:
every escape character is a vaild char literal 

char ch = '\n';
char ch = '\t';
char ch = '\m'; \\ CE: illegal Escape character

**Escape Character** | **Description**  
--- | ---  
`\n` | New Line  
`\t` | Horizontal Tab  
`\r` | Carriage Return  
`\b` | Back Space  
`\f` | Form Feed  
`\'` | Single Quote  
`\"` | Double Quote  
`\\` | Backslash  

**Examples:**
```javascript
Sop( "This is \ Symbol" );
Sop( "This is \ " Symbol" );
Sop( "This is \ Character" );
```

which of the following 


String literal:

any sequence of chanracters witih dubble questoes is treasted as string literal
string s = "durga";

java 1.7 enhacement w.r.t literals

1. binanry literals:

int x = 0 ,1

int b = 0B0111

for integeral datatype we can sepcify literal values in the following ways 
decimal, octal, hexadecimal we can sepficly even in binary form also
allowd digits are 0 and 1 
literal values shoud be prefiexed with 0b or 0B 
Examples
int x = 0B111;
int y = 0b011;

uses of underscore Symbol in numeric literl
from 1.7 v we can use _ between numeric literal 

e.g :
double d = 123456.789;
double d = 1_23_456.7_8_9
double d = 123_456.7_8_9

at the time of compilatino this _ symobls will be removd automatially hence after compilation the above lins becomes 
double d = 123456.789;

we can use more thean one _ symbola als in digits

e.g: 

we can _ symbol only in digits if we are suing anywere in the compiler gvie erroer
double d = -1_23_456.7_8_9j;  
double d = 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9j;  
double d = 1_23_456.7_8_9;

*Note: B denotes bytes for the data types.*

8 byte long value we can assiggn to 4 byte float variable becase both are following differnt memroy represent interanally
float f = 10l;
sout(f); //10.0
